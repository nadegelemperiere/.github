## WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ME ?

* 🐈‍⬛: I love cats, but between you and me, who does not ? What's best than the loving song of a meowing cat at 3 am ? 
* 🐋: I love working with containers, give me the impression of being much more tidy than I really am ! Check https://github.com/nadegelemperiere-docker to see the docker image I manage carefully
* 🧒: I've got 2 ~~awful~~ wonderful boys who fill the house with a lot of ~~trash~~ love and energy
* 🌎: Terraforming is easier when you don't have to go to mars to do it! Check https://github.com/nadegelemperiere-aws to have a look of the standardized AWS modules I use for my infrastructure deployments
* 🗽: I'm so terribly French, but for now, I leave next to New York baby!
* 🧱: On week ends, I coach a First Lego League Team : [website](https://the-green-brick-road.org) and it's fun! Therefore, I work a bit on spike lego https://github.com/nadegelemperiere-aws. But those are only my tentative projects, the real stuff is under https://github.com/the-greeen-brick-road and it's private! 🤫
